# downloader
GUI for yt-dl using ffmpeg

Allows the user to download video & audio from youtube links and specify a portion of the video they want to download.

To run, download the zip file `downloader.zip` and extract then run `downloader.exe`. Make sure the exe file stays in the same directory as the other files.

Or if you have python's compiler, clone the repo and run `py downloader.py`.

Note, the program will enter a `not responding` state while working, just don't touch it.

I plan to fix this with multithreading later.
